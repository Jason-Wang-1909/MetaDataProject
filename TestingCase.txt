Test case
1. use Eclipse and Postman to test the API
2. run the API on Eclipse and start the service
3. start the Postman 
4. under the "New Tab", choose "post" method and type in "http://localhost:8080/upload" 
5. click on "Body" tab and choose "form-data"
6. under "key" tab, type in "file" (this is the file name will be consumed by the API), then go to the drop-down menu to the right and change the format from "text" to "file"
7. once file upload button appears, choose a file from the file system 
8. go to the next line and type in "Id" in the key field and any number (this is the userId of clients) in the value field
9. then click on "send" on the top-right corner.
10. the response will be displayed, including the meta info of the file uploaded such as userId, fileSize and uploadedDate.
11. repeat step 6 to 9 for other tests with different files and userIds
12. it also allows querying the existing files info by using "get" method with query address "http://localhost:8080/findAll" and "http://localhost:8080/findById/{userId}"

// the API will create a '/upload' folder under the root directory of the application, and create a sub-folder for each user with the userId being the sub-folder name
// the upload file limit is set to 10MB
